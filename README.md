# COVID-19 Global Health Analytics (2020–2026)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends from 2020 to 2026 using official World Health Organization (WHO) data.  
The goal is to extract meaningful public health insights through data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization.

The analysis is designed to support:
- Public health decision-making
- Medical and epidemiological research
- Health policy evaluation
- Data-driven insights for global health systems

## Key Questions Addressed
- How did COVID-19 cases and deaths evolve globally and across regions?
- How do case fatality rates differ between countries and continents?
- What were the major waves and peaks of the pandemic?
- How did vaccination rollout impact cases and deaths?
- How do healthcare outcomes vary across regions?

## Data Source
- World Health Organization (WHO)
- Coverage: Global (all countries and continents)
- Time span: 2020–2026
- Data type: Cases, deaths, vaccination, hospitalization indicators

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
